# South America Natural Wonders

This is an interactive map containing all South America Natural Wonders I have visited during the last few years.

This App was built using JavaScript, jQuery, knockoutJS, Google Maps API, and Instagram API. 

## Demo



## How to install

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Unzip the files
3. Open index.html

## Using the App

Users can filter the list of Natural Wonders based on either name or country name. When searching, both the Natural Worders list and the markers will be filtered according to the search criteria.

## Dependencies

This App requires a Google Maps API key and an Instagram API access token to work properly.
