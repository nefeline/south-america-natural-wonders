# South America Natural Wonders

This App is an interactive map containing all South America Natural Wonders I have visited during the last few years. It was built using JavaScript, jQuery, knockoutJS, Google Maps API, and Instagram API.

This Project was built for Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree.
